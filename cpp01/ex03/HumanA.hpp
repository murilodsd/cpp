/* 
Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB. They both have a Weapon and
a name. They also have a member function attack() that displays (without the angle
brackets):
<name> attacks with their <weapon type>
HumanA and HumanB are almost identical except for these two small details:
• While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB does not.
• HumanB may not always have a weapon, whereas HumanA will always be
armed
